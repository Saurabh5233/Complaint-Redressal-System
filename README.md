Guidance:-
1. Dashboard from crash as existing are just as a waste. 
2. Complain status check
3. Grievances must be accurate as per govt. Position 
4. Timeline for each escalation like as we move to higher position it should be more time (i.e. if for clerk it must be like 7 days, then SHO like 15 days and if higher to all like collector then around 1 month just for example ) , it should be only of max. Time of 6 months approx of all the Escalation. 
5. All the escalation and process must be logged for each complain and user 
6. Authentication can be done by aadhar and phone no. together. 
7. All offices post details to be known and create a particular id for each officer by our admin 
8. All help desk contact detail for particular district or taluka
9. Plan according so to make it for the state and country level too, not to lack till the district. 
10. After each escalation or query resolved, user must get a sms/email. 
11. Sms Or alert to the officials on both sides of escalation regarding one has not worked and other is to do it as pior based on queue. 
12. If complain is not resolved and user wants to file a complain again he/she must have a option to recomplain in attachment to older so to check who has made it in resolved list but yet not resolved. 
13. Each grievance level should be shown to user and the detail of officer (like phone no./mail or address) .  As the grievance is main task the higher authorities must be able to see the grievance level it has travel so to take actions accordingly. 
14. Check for the duplicate complains raised from same user and attached them together. 
15. Create a auto sms Or whatsApp not to answer the user regarding some basic complains which user can do itself. 
16. Provide language translates to stream for all users. 
17. For each query or complain provide a token/ticket id to check status. 
Note:- More info to be passed as upon talk with the consern person and our guide.
